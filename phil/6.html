It felt strangely distanced , or observing, compared to what one has come to expect from today s fiction. But, given time, the show grew on me with its intriguing, though slightly confusing story line, and its interesting characters. But it will not be everyones cup of tea. Not all hints, plot elements and dialogue seem to go somewhere. Emphasis on characters change unexpectedly, as do perspectives and general direction. The style of the series feels a bit like observing events around you in real life where things are not easily interpreted, but none the less interesting enough for you to keep looking. For me, this style gave the show a touch of realism that made it enjoyable, even refreshing. Like its titular object, the series is a mosaic of sorts with odd fragments beginning to come together as you watch the story unfold.</p> </span> 23 of 28 people found this review helpful.
